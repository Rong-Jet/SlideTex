      "- **Definition:** The process where a disordered system of pre-existing components forms an organized structure or pattern due to specific, local interactions among the components, happening without external direction.\n",
      "- **Molecular self-assembly:** When the components involved are molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relevant Concepts:\n",
      "- **Disordered system:** A system where the components are initially in a random or unordered state.\n",
      "- **Organized structure:** The final state where the components have formed a specific pattern or configuration.\n",
      "- **Local interactions:** Interactions among components in close proximity that drive the assembly process.\n",
      "- **Without external direction:** The process occurs naturally without the need for an external guiding force.\n",

      "- **Bottom Image (House Puzzle):** Represents the organized structure formed through self-assembly.\n",

      "1. **Graph a (Time vs. Moduli):**\n",
      "   - **Storage Modulus (solid line)** and **Loss Modulus (dotted line):** These lines indicate the elastic and viscous response of the hydrogel over time.\n",
